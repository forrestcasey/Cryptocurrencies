# Cryptocurrencies

A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. A report is to be created that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data must be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what they are looking for, we are using unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. Sheâ€™ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.

A clustering algorithm will be used to group the cryptocurrencies, and findings from the data visuaizations will be shared with the board. 

## There are 4 steps to this analysis that involved :

1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
